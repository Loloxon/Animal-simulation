# The project has been carried out as part of the Object-Oriented Programming subject in the field of Computer Science at the AGH University of Science and Technology

The aim of the project was to create simulation where there are animals (symbolised as pacmans) which move, eat grass in order to increase their enegry (which is nessescary to survive, the more energy animal has, the darker it is), age and copulate with each other exchanging theirs' geens (geens symbolise the preferences of each animal how often they will rotate in which direction).

The simulation has beed created in two versions, one with folded world (animals can move through edges) and one with world with edges. Moreover it is possible to stop each of the simulation independly as well as choose an animal. Doing so, shows its genotype, some other informations and gives possibility to highlight all of its children, which were born after chosing that animal.

There are also some statistics, such as number of grass and animals currently existing
