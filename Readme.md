# The project has been carried out as part of the Object-Oriented Programming subject in the field of Computer Science at the AGH University of Science and Technology

The aim of the project was to create simulation where there are animals (symbolised as pacmans) which move, eat grass in order to increase their enegry (which is nessescary to survive), age and copulate with each other exchanging theirs' geens (geens symbolise the preferences of each animal how often they will rotate in which direction).

The simulation has beed created in two versions, one with folded world (animals can move through edges) and one with world with edges. More over there is possibility to stop each of the simulation independly as well as choose an animal to show its genotype, some other informations and all of its future children.
